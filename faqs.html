      <h1 class="faqs_h1">About Our Adventures!</h1>
      <p class="faqs_p">
        You&#39;ve probably spent countless hours in front of a screen watching
        a hero save the world, solve a mystery, or plan a prison break. Now
        it&#39;s your turn! The Great Escape of Central Texas offers an escape
        from ordinary life that allows you to live out the stories you love.
        Here&#39;s how it works: You and your team are locked in a room and have
        one hour to complete a mission and escape. Escaping will require
        teamwork, quick thinking, determination and a sense of urgency! From the
        moment you step into your game, you&#39;ll be totally immersed in our
        world.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faqs_h3">HOW DO I BOOK A GAME?</h3>
      <p class="faqs_p">
        Please book your game online at
        GreatEscapeCTX.com/tickets-gift-certificates
      </p>

      <h3 class="faqs_h3">Will I be playing with other participants?</h3>
      <!-- The p element is used for the answers to the questions on the FAQ page -->
      <p class="faqs_p">
        No! ALL games are PRIVATE experiences. You will NOT be joining or be
        joined by anyone outside your group.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faqs_h3">DOES A PARENT HAVE TO GO INTO THE ROOM WITH KIDS?</h3>
      <p class="faqs_p">
        Well, not a parent exactly but a paying adult aged 18 years or over must
        be in the room. The adult is taking responsibility for the actions of
        those they are supervising.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faqs_h3">CAN I ADD MORE PLAYERS TO MY BOOKING?</h3>
      <p class="faqs_p">
        Yes! As long as you do NOT exceed the quantity of seats the room hold
        you can click the "View/Change" button on your confirmation email or
        simply pay on the day of your game. Just arrive extra early to purchase
        the extra tickets.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faqs_h3">Do you offer Military discounts?</h3>
      <p class="faqs_p">
        We do NOT offer a military discount at this time. Since COVID arrived we
        have made each room a PRIVATE experience therefore you are not required
        to purchase all of the seats. Because of this we have eliminated the
        offering of a military discount on top of the current discount of
        getting all of the seats a room holds.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faqs_h3">How do I book an entire room?</h3>
      <p class="faqs_p">
        ALL games are PRIVATE whether you buy all of the seats or not, however,
        there are a minimum number of tickets for each room that must be
        purchased whether you bring the minimum number or not.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faqs_h3">
        How do I book multiple participants at the same time?
      </h3>
      <p class="faqs_p">
        Simply select the number of players you will be bringing in the drop
        down menu at the top of the booking page. Be advised that once you have
        completed your transaction, any seats that remain will be blocked off to
        keep others from joining you. Be sure your count is correct.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faqs_h3">Do I need to book in advance?</h3>
      <p class="faqs_p">
        Yes, we strongly recommend booking a reservation at
        GreatEscapeCTX.com/tickets-gift-certificates. Choosing not to runs the
        risk of not being able to play.
